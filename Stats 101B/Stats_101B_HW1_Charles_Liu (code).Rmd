# Exercise 6 (Problem 2.29)

## a)
```{r}
C2F6_125 <- c(2.7, 4.6, 2.6, 3.0, 3.2, 3.8)
C2F6_200 <- c(4.6, 3.4, 2.9, 3.5, 4.1, 5.1)

t.test(C2F6_125, C2F6_200)
```

No, C2F6 Flow Rate does not affect average etch uniformity.


## b)
```{r}
t.test(C2F6_125, C2F6_200)$p.value # Our p-value is approximately 0.21
```


## c)
```{r}
var.test(C2F6_125, C2F6_200, alternative = "two.sided") 
# F0 = 0.86 and our p-value = 0.87
```

Do NOT reject the Null Hypothesis. The C2F6 Flow Rate does not affect wafer-to-wafer variability.


## d)
```{r}
boxplot(C2F6_125, C2F6_200, main = "Boxplot for Flow Rates", names = c("C2F6 125", "C2F6 200"), xlab = "C2F6 Flow Rates", ylab = "Uniformity")
```

The boxplot shown indicates that there is little to no difference in uniformity for the two types of flow rates.
