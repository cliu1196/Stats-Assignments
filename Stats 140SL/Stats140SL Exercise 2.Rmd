Please try a little Overleaf.  You might not finish this in class, that's OK, the point is to learn a little bit and to work as a team

1.  Have at least one team member get a project started in Overleaf and share it with the rest of the team.

2.  Please examine https://www.overleaf.com/read/pfdmjpyytyqt specifically "hello_world.tex", copy (download) and paste this to a new file in your team's project.

3.  Try compiling (hope it runs without error - if there is an error, get me to visit your room)

4.  Team Challenge -- can your team take a file like Sweaving.Rtex or betterposterexample.tex and compile it successfully -- you will need to copy a few image files.
