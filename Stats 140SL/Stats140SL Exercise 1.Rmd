Using any built-in dataset (if necessary), please modify this .Rmd document and have these features present in your knitted result:

1.  Sections (e.g., Introduction, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion)
2.  An R chunk
3.  An R graphic (e.g., like ggplot output)
4.  An external graphic
5. (challenge 1)  Change the default font
6. (challenge 2)  Add some symbols, like a bit of calculus or something like currency symbols (e.g., Yen, Pound sterling)

When you are done, please return to the main room.  If you don't finish, don't fret, we can talk about what happened.


# Loading Necessary Package(s)
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```



# 1. Sections

## A) Introduction
This section talks about the introduction of the problem.

## B) Data
```{r}
data(mtcars) # Load the data
```

## C) Methods
This section talks about the methods used.

## D) Results
This section explains the results found from the data.


## E) Conclusion
This section wraps up the conclusion of the problem and what was analyzed.



# 2. An R Chunk
```{r}
# This right here is a R chunk
```



# 3. An R Graphic
```{r}
g <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=wt))
g + geom_point() +     
  ggtitle("Fuel Efficiency Based on Weight") +
  xlab("Miles per Gallon") + ylab("Weight (in lbs.)") +
  theme_bw()
```



# 4. An external graphic

# 5. (challenge 1)  Change the default font
To change the default font of R, you would go to the *Tools* tab in the top left tabs bar. Under *Tools*, you'll find something called "Global Options..." and enter in here. It'll have a pop-up menu and go to the *Appearance* section. You'll find there that you can change the default font of R under soemthing called "Editor Font".



# 6. (challenge 2)  Add some symbols, like a bit of calculus or something like currency symbols (e.g., Yen, Pound sterling)
```{r}
x <- "\U00B5"
print(x) # symbol for "mu"
```
You would use **unicode symbols** by inserting the correct code used for each symbol, but you would need to make sure to surround the code in quotation marks.
