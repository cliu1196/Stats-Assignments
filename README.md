  7) Stats 101A (Introduction to Data Analysis and Regression)
        - Understanding advance techniques on R for regression analysis
        - Emphasized on general linear model (i.e. multiple regression) and generalized linear model (i.e. logistic regression).
        - Additional concepted include modern extensions of regression (regression diagnostics, graphical procedures, and bootstrapping for statistical influence)
  8) Stats 101B (Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiment)
        - Utilizing R to further create models such as fractional factorial designs and randomized blocks (RCBD, Latin square design, and BIBD)
  9) Stats 101C (Introduction to Statistical Models and Data Mining)

  10) Stats 102A (Introduction to Computational Statistics with R)
        - Covering topics in R such as subsetting, writing functions, the different packages (tidyr, dplyr, web scraping, etc.), regular expressions and advance R graphing techniques, numerical methods (floating point arithmetic, root finding, optimization), and various tests (randomization tests, permutation tests, and bootstrapping)
  11) Stats 102B (Introduction to Computation and Optimization for Statistics)
        - Covering topics in R such as loss functions, optimization (Matrix calculus, Gradient Descent, and Maximum Likelihood models), Overfitting, Cross Validation, Regularization (LASSO, Ridge), Neural Networks, and Classification (Bayes Classifier, KNN, and Support Vector Machines), Clustering (K-means, Mixture models)
  12) Stats 102C (Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods)
